# MelodyDrumMachine ðŸŽµ
A virtual drum machine made in OpenGL 
---

The `DIST` folder holds the executables and running `melody.exe` should get the app started. \
The source is in the main `main.cpp` file. \
`DIST/mixer.py` is an audio engine that plays the song you wrote using the app. \
The app also exports a sharable `.mel` file which has your song in it. (refer `DIST/example.mel` for the same)
